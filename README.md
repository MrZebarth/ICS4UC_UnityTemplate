5. As you work in Unity, whenever you make major changes, make sure you commit and push your work.

6. When you are finished, hit the submit button!

### **NOTE**
I'm giving you one repository for each chapter. That means you must include your challenge AND your level work at the same time. If they are in separate projects, make sure you include the entire file, NOT just the contents!
